Idea
===
The idea for this project is to create stock trading engine using historical stock records found at Kaggle (see below for details). The engine applies
the algorithms to be tested against the historical records and scores how well it does.

Later on, given a few algorithms, the engine can be used to create a score board showing the best algorithms and their scores.

Data
===
The data for used for the engine is to large to upload here but can be found at:
